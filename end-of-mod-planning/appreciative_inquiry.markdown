# Final Friday School Visioning Session

## Connection to Mission
"Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers.

To advance this mission, it's important that Turing be a learning organization that can adapt to the needs of students and the market of employment opportunities. This requires that Turing have sound routines and practices for understanding what we do well and continue to invest in that work. 

Appreciative Inquiry is a "change management approach that focuses on identifying what is working well, analyzing why it is working well and then doing more of it. The basic tenet of AI is that an organization will grow in whichever direction that people in the organization focus their attention" ([source](http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/Appreciative-inquiry-AI)). Whereas traditional approaches to organizational development focus on gaps and problems, AI focuses on developing around an organization's strengths.

Problem Solving | Appreciative Inquiry
------------- | -----------
“Felt Need” – Identification of Problem | Appreciating and valuing the best of “What is”
Analysis of Causes | Envisioning “What Might Be”
Analysis of Possible Solutions | Dialoguing “What Should Be”
Action Planning | Innovating “What Will Be”
Assumes: organization is a problem to be solved | Assumes: organization is a mystery to be embraced
Back Door: What’s in the way of what you want? | Front Door: What do you want to create?

Today we will use an AI approach to reflect on our past module and build on our strengths as we look forward to the next. 

## Agenda
* Reflection
* Small Group Discussion
* Small Group Synthesis
* Report Out and Voting
* Planning

## Reflection (10 min)
Write privately about the following questions. 

As a student, what were your wildest hopes about Turing?  
How did you expect it to feel? sound? look like?  
What do you appreciate about Turing? (“What is…”)  
What do you think would be great for Turing to become? (“What might be…”)  
What do you think Turing should be? (“Should be”)  

## Small Group Discussion (20 min)
Count off in groups of 5. Assign the following roles to people in your group. 

* **Timekeeper:** Ensure that the group has a chance to address all the discussion questions and time at the end to complete the survey.

* **Facilitator:** Works with the timekeeper to move through the discussion questions. Solicits input from all members of the group and helps individuals be aware if they are dominating the conversation.

* **Participant (all):** Listens actively, is respectful and engaged, takes responsibility for all members having a chance to share their perspectives and learn from others.

As a group, discuss the questions “what might be” and “what should be." Write down the list of ideas that your group thinks "should be." 

## Report Out and Voting (5 min)
Send a representative from your group to the front of the room where your site is gathered. Each group representative will report out their ideas. Topics will be posted in Slack for each person to vote on. After everyone has voted, students will split into groups based on the topics they're interested in and will develop a plan of action for developing around that strength next module. 

## Planning (25 min)
What would it take, look like to launch this idea?
