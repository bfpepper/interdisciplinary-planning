## Reflection (10 min)
As a student, what were your wildest hopes about Turing?  
How did you expect it to feel? sound? look like?  
What do you appreciate about Turing? (“What is…”)  
What do you think would be great for Turing to become? (“What might be…”)  
What do you think Turing should be? (“Should be”)  

## Small Group Discussion (15 min)
Count off in groups of 4.
Assign someone to take notes.
As a group, discuss the questions “what might be” and “what should be"

## Small Group Review (5 min)
Which of these (“should be”) do you as students have direct control over?

## Report Out and Voting (5 min)
Share topics and vote. Students rearrange based on the topics they’re most interested in.

## Planning (25 min)
